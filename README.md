# launch-tools

A collection of simple node utilities for launching to different testnets & mainnets.

## ðŸ’… Setup

Install the stuff

```bash
# Step 1
yarn

# Step 2
./build_contracts.sh
```

### Optional: Setup a local node

If you intend to launch on a local node, you need to install the following:

1. Follow the [install guide for cosmjs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/HACKING.md#checking-out-code)
2. `yarn install` at the root
3. `cd scripts/wasmd/` then `nano template/.wasmd/config/genesis.json` and change `"max_wasm_code_size": "614400"` to `"max_wasm_code_size": "654400"`
4. [Setup & run wasmd docker instance](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/tree/main/scripts/wasmd)

This should be run in a diff terminal, or docker runtime. See the `start.sh` & `init.sh` files runs properly and is ready before proceeding.
